`Jupybricks` is a `python package` that allows `databricks developers` to switch easily between `local development in jupyter notebooks` and `databricks notebooks`. 

# What `Jupybricks` does
* convert databricks .py files into jupyter notebooks to work on your local machine
* convert local jupyter notebooks to .py files which can be read by databricks notebooks
 
By using Jupybricks you can benefit from your local IDE and in addition save databricks costs. No more manual refactoring needed if you want to deploy notebooks from you local machine to databricks (and back).
